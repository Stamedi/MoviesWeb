Ad Astra (Latin for "To the Stars") is a 2019 American psychological science fiction film produced, co-written, and directed by James Gray. Starring Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga, Liv Tyler, and Donald Sutherland, it follows an astronaut who ventures into space in search of his lost father, whose obsession at all costs to find intelligent alien life threatens the solar system and all life on the earth. The project was announced in early 2016, with Gray saying he wanted to feature "the most realistic depiction of space travel that's been put in a movie". Pitt signed on to star in April 2017 and the rest of the cast joined later that year. Filming began around Los Angeles that August, lasting through October.

Ad Astra premiered at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on September 20, 2019, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through its division 20th Century Fox.[5] It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Pitt's performance, Gray's direction, visual effects, and the cinematography.[6] However, the film was a box office bomb, grossing $135 million worldwide against an $80â€“100 million budget. At the 92nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Sound Mixing.
