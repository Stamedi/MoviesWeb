The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is a 2015 American live-action/animated comedy film directed by Paul Tibbitt in his directorial debut.[6] It is the second film adaptation of the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants and a standalone sequel to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004). The film stars Antonio Banderas and features the show's regular voice cast who reprised their roles from the television series and the previous film.[7] The plot follows a pirate named Burger Beard, who steals the secret Krabby Patty formula using a magical book that makes any text written upon it come true. SpongeBob and his friends must travel to the ocean's surface to confront Burger Beard and retrieve the formula.

The film was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, who adapted it from a story conceived by Tibbit and SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg. Like the first film, the final act places the animated characters in a live-action world. These scenes were directed by Mike Mitchell and were filmed in Savannah and Tybee Island, Georgia. Filming began on October 9, 2013 and was completed in November that year. The film is dedicated to Ernest Borgnine, the voice of Mermaid Man, who died in 2012. Similarly, it features the final film role of Tim Conway, the voice of Barnacle Boy, before his death in 2019.

The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was released in the United States on February 6, 2015 and received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was a box office success, earning over $325 million worldwide against its $60â€“74 million budget, making it the third-highest-grossing Nickelodeon film and the 6th highest-grossing animated film of 2015. A third film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, was released in 2020.
